A summary of the status of all the projects to date.

## DID: Decentralized Identifiers (Ryan G.)

v4 Spec should be arriving tomorrow.

Consensus on what DIDs look like and what they mean.

Ideas about DiDs on BtC, Uport, Ethereum, and self-sovereign; different methods can be defined for DIDs on different blockchains (or even multiple DIDs on the same blockchain)

Big issues
   * Format for proof of control
   * Revocation
   * Cross-platform proofs of equivalence

## Identity Containers (Daniel B.)

Top level function areas:
   * /profile
   * /data/:context
   * /permissions 
   * /stores
   
Containers live on edge devices, so stays fresh

Open Issues:
   * Permissions
   * Permissioning Rules
   * Recovery
