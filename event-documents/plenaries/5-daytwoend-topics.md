A summary of the status of all the projects to date.

## DID: Decentralized Identifiers (Ryan G.)

v4 Spec should be arriving tomorrow.

Consensus on what DIDs look like and what they mean.

Ideas about DiDs on BtC, Uport, Ethereum, and self-sovereign; different methods can be defined for DIDs on different blockchains (or even multiple DIDs on the same blockchain)

Big issues
   * Format for proof of control
   * Revocation
   * Cross-platform proofs of equivalence

## Identity Containers (Daniel B.)

Top level function areas:
   * /profile
   * /data/:context
   * /permissions 
   * /stores
   
Containers live on edge devices, so stays fresh

Open Issues:
   * Permissions
   * Permissioning Rules
   * Recovery
   
## Joram (Joe A., Bob)

UN SDG 16.9 compatible identity engagement model (and extended use case).

This is one through-line of a sample experience.

Joram is a Syrian refugee who is washed up on shores of Greece.

He's then brought in refugee system and identified using a Self-sovereign identity data store.

## Bootstrapping Identity & User Adoption (Matt, 

   * Looked at traditional and bitworld records and found problems with each.
   * Looked at benefits and value proposition of decentralized identity.
   * Looked at challenges of decentralized services

How can we actually create _initial_ moment of trust? 

Created a few bootrapping models
   * Direct, in-person KYC to SSID
   * Centralized KYC Holder Distributing Existing Attestations to SSID
   * SSID + Social Media Link
   * P2P + Entity Attestation

## Digital Licensing of Intellectual Properties (Shawn, COALA Co-Author

Co-Sent Receipt & COALA IP 
   * Looking at their similarities and differences
   
About consent mechanism of self-sovereign data

What happens to data after its been shed?

**Spec Out Tomorrow.**

## Portable Reputation Toolkit

Creating schema for: reputation + DID + timestamp + signature 

Breaking apart assertion and evaluation and evidence

1. Get DID
2. Make Signed claims with timestamps
3. Query claims
4. Evaluate claims with evidence
