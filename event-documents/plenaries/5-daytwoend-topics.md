A summary of the status of all the projects to date.

## DID: Decentralized Identifiers (Ryan G.)

v4 Spec should be arriving tomorrow.

Consensus on what DIDs look like and what they mean.

Ideas about DiDs on BtC, Uport, Ethereum, and self-sovereign; different methods can be defined for DIDs on different blockchains (or even multiple DIDs on the same blockchain)

Big issues
   * Format for proof of control
   * Revocation
   * Cross-platform proofs of equivalence

## Identity Containers (Daniel B.)

Top level function areas:
   * /profile
   * /data/:context
   * /permissions 
   * /stores
   
Containers live on edge devices, so stays fresh

Open Issues:
   * Permissions
   * Permissioning Rules
   * Recovery
   
## Joram (Joe A., Bob)

UN SDG 16.9 compatible identity engagement model (and extended use case).
This is one through-line of a sample experience.

Joram is a Syrian refugee who is washed up on shores of Greece.
He's then brought in refugee system and identified using a Self-sovereign identity data store.

## Bootstrapping Identity & User Adoption (Matt, 

Looked at traditional and bitworld records and found problems with each.
Looked at benefits and value proposition of decentralized identity.
Looked at challenges of decentralized services

How can we actually create _initial_ moment of trust? 
Created a few bootrapping models
   1 Direct, in-person KYC to SSID
   2 Centralized KYC Holder Distributing Existing Attestations to SSID
   3 SSID + Social Media Link
   4 P2P + Entity Attestation
