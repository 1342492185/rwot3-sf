## Good Use Cases (Joe Andrieu)

Fluid Development supports requirements modeling, centered on use cases. 

A use case should define how a system is used with a value-creating transaction (creating value for the human user).

A good use case:
* Is a single transaction
* Has a clear, memorable name
* Distinguishes unique capabilities
* Is describable, empathizable, actionable.

There are two ways to think about use cases, as a problem or a solution. Either is incomplete, need them together as action/reaction pair.
