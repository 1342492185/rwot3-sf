We are writing proof of concept scripts to bring together a _Portable Reputation Toolkit_ proof of concept.  The scripts should: 

- Generate DIDs
- Create signed verifiable claims
- Create proof of existence for these claims on a blockchain
- Retrieve existing claims

Stretch goals:

- Allow a user to request a claim 
- Search and filtering when retrieving claims
