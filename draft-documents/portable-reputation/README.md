# Portable Reputation
We are writing proof of concept scripts to bring together a _Portable
Reputation Toolkit_ proof of concept.  The scripts should:

- Generate DIDs
- Create signed verifiable claims
- Create proof of existence for these claims on a blockchain
- Retrieve existing claims

Stretch goals:

- Allow a user to request a claim
- Search and filtering when retrieving claims

## Installation

(TODO: Make installing easier.)

```
$ cd ots
# Create a virtual environment
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
# TODO: More?
