## Rebooting the Web of Trust III: San Francisco (October 2016)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT3, the third Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which ran in San Francisco, CA, on October 19th-21st, 2016. The goal of the workshop was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the future.

## Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Advance Readings README](topics-and-advance-readings/README.md) for a listing of all of the papers.

## Completed Papers

The design workshop exceeded its mandate by producing seven papers, which are now all available online:
